# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to gain further insight into the relationship between PyBer’s ride customers and the costs of rides based on various geographical locations. Furthermore, PyBer is seeking actionable information, which could increase PyBer’s coverage and overall profitability.

# Results
Through analysis, Urban cities have the highest amount of rides, while simultaneously, having the lowest average fare per ride. Alternatively, rural cities are the opposite. Rural cities account for the lowest demographic of total rides and cost the most per fare per ride. As the population of cities expands to more rural areas, PyBer needs fewer drivers. Within suburban and urban areas the demand is much higher, meaning more drivers are needed to cover these areas

# Summary

	Recommendation #1- Increase urban fare prices to offset rural fares. 

To potentially increase PyBer usage in rural areas, decreasing the average fare per ride, may generate more customer willingness to partake in the service.

Recommendation #2- Increase the number of drivers in urban cities.

If my first recommendation is implemented, more drivers would be needed to cover for the increased usage from the suburban and rural cities. 

Recommendation #3- Create a ride sharing part to Pyber’s service

Creating a ride sharing service may improve urban and suburban customers to consider a cheaper alternative to driving, or paying for the service on their own.
